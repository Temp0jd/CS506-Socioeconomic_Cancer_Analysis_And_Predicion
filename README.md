# CS506-Socioeconomic_Cancer_Analysis_And_Predicion
Analyzing the effect of socioeconomic factors on cancer incidence and mortality
# Socioeconomic Factors and Cancer Rates

## Description of the Project
This project investigates the relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer incidence/mortality. 
By analyzing key variables such as median income and poverty levels across different U.S. counties, 
we aim to determine if there is a significant correlation between these factors.

## Goals
- Analyze the correlation between socioeconomic factors and cancer rates.
- Determine the statistical significance of income and poverty levels on cancer incidence and mortality.
- Apply hypothesis testing and regression models to quantify relationships.
- Visualize findings using effective data visualizations.

## Data Collection
- **Sources:** Cancer data (CDC, SEER), socioeconomic data (US Census, ACS)
- **Method:** Public dataset downloads, API access, and preprocessing.

## Modeling Approach
- **Statistical Models:** Linear Regression, Hypothesis Testing (Alexander-Govern Test), Correlation Analysis.
- **Potential Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, XGBoost (if necessary).

## Data Visualization
- Scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, geospatial maps.

## Test Plan
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing.
- **Cross-validation:** Apply techniques to ensure robustness.
- **Statistical Tests:** Validate findings with hypothesis testing.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Data Collection, Preprocessing, and EDA.
- **Week 3-4:** Initial Modeling and Hypothesis Testing.
- **Week 5-6:** Model Refinement and Advanced Techniques.
- **Week 7:** Final Visualization and Interpretation.
- **Week 8:** Report Writing and Presentation Preparation.
