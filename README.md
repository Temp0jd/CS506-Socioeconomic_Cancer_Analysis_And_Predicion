## 1. Project Description

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and multiple studies suggest that socioeconomic factors may play a role in cancer incidence and mortality rates. This project investigates the relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer rates by analyzing key variables such as median income and poverty levels across U.S. counties.

The study aims to determine whether lower income levels correlate with higher cancer incidence and mortality rates and whether certain regions are disproportionately affected due to socioeconomic disparities. By leveraging statistical modeling techniques, this project will assess the strength and significance of these relationships.

---

## 2. Project Goals

The primary objectives of this study are:

- **Analyze the correlation** between socioeconomic factors and cancer rates
- **Determine the statistical significance** of income and poverty levels on cancer incidence and mortality
- **Apply hypothesis testing and regression models** to quantify relationships
- **Visualize findings** using effective data visualizations

---

## 3. Data Collection Plan

The data used in this study consists of county-level cancer rates and socioeconomic variables. The primary sources include:

- **Cancer incidence and mortality data** (e.g., obtained from the CDC, SEER database, or public health datasets)
- **Socioeconomic data** such as median household income and poverty rates (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey)
- **Additional demographic and regional data** to control for potential confounding factors

If necessary, data will be preprocessed by cleaning missing values, normalizing numerical variables, and encoding categorical features.

---

## 4. Data Modeling Approach

To evaluate the impact of socioeconomic factors on cancer rates, the following methods will be implemented:

- **Linear Regression:** To model the relationship between median income/poverty levels and cancer rates
- **Hypothesis Testing** (e.g., Alexander-Govern Test): To determine if significant differences exist among different income groups
- **Correlation Analysis:** To assess how strongly different socioeconomic variables relate to cancer incidence and mortality
- **Potential Advanced Models:** If necessary, decision trees or machine learning approaches (e.g., XGBoost) may be explored

---

## 5. Data Visualization Plan

To effectively communicate the findings, the following visualizations will be used:

- **Scatter plots** to illustrate the correlation between cancer rates and socioeconomic variables
- **Bar charts** showing differences in cancer rates across income groups
- **Heatmaps** for correlation matrices to identify strong relationships
- **Geospatial visualizations** to highlight regional disparities

---

## 6. Test Plan

To validate the findings and ensure model robustness:

- Data will be split into **training (80%) and testing (20%) sets** for model validation
- **Cross-validation techniques** may be applied to prevent overfitting
- **Statistical significance testing** will be conducted to confirm findings
- If time permits, **sensitivity analysis** will be performed to check how different model assumptions impact the results.

</p>

## Data processing Tasks
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: 
  - `cancer_reg.csv` - Cancer-related statistics.
  - `avg-household-size.csv` - Household size data.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Stripped column names of extra spaces and converted to lowercase.
  - Merged datasets based on the `geography` column.
  - Extracted `county` and `state` from the `geography` column.
  - Removed less relevant columns such as `index`, `studypercap`, `percentmarried`, etc.

### Correlation Analysis and Initial Modeling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Computed correlations between various features and `avgdeathsperyear`.
  - Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
  - Plotted scatter plots to examine relationships between `povertypercent`, `education`, and cancer deaths.
- **Regression Modeling**:
  - Selected key independent variables based on correlation analysis.
  - Fitted a linear regression model to predict `avgdeathsperyear`.
  - Evaluated model performance using R-squared and residual analysis.
  - Identified potential non-linearity in relationships, indicating possible improvements with advanced regression techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created a new `region` variable by mapping states into broader regions.
  - Identified strong and weak correlations between socioeconomic factors and cancer mortality rates.

## Data Modeling Methods: XGBoost
- **Algorithm:** `XGBRegressor` from the `xgboost.sklearn` package.  
- **Purpose:** We applied XGBoost due to its efficiency and performance in handling complex datasets with non-linear relationships. This model provides great flexibility and can handle large datasets with many features.  
- **Parameters:**  
  - `n_estimators=1000`: We chose a high number of estimators to ensure enough boosting rounds to capture the complexity of the data.
  - `learning_rate=0.1`: A moderate learning rate was chosen to prevent overshooting during training.
  - `early_stopping_rounds=5`: We implemented early stopping to avoid overfitting by stopping training when the performance on the validation set stopped improving.
- **Pipeline Integration:** The preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features, were included in a `Pipeline` to ensure the consistency of transformations during both training and prediction phases.  
- **Model Evaluation:** We used a separate validation set (`X_test` and `y_test`) to evaluate model performance.

## Preliminary Results
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Strong positive correlation between poverty rate and cancer deaths.
  - Moderate negative correlation between higher education rates and cancer deaths.
- **Data Trends**:
  - States with higher poverty percentages tend to have higher average deaths per year.
  - Regions with higher educational attainment show slightly lower cancer mortality rates.
- **Regression Model**:
  - The model shows that poverty rate has a significant positive coefficient, indicating a strong association with cancer mortality.
  - Adjusted R-squared value suggests a moderate fit, indicating potential for further feature refinement.
  - Residual analysis shows some non-linearity, suggesting possible improvements with polynomial terms or interaction effects.
- **XGBoost**:
  - The XGBoost model showed promising results in terms of accuracy and predictive performance.
  - By incorporating early stopping and tuning hyperparameters such as the number of estimators and the learning rate, we were able to achieve reasonable predictions with minimal overfitting.
- **Current Issue**:
  - Feature selection needed to be refined based on correlation findings.
  - Consider additional socioeconomic or healthcare-related features for deeper insights.

## Next Steps  
- Hyperparameter tuning of the XGBoost model to improve performance using cross-validation.
- Feature selection to refine the model and potentially enhance prediction accuracy.
- Further evaluation on the test set to validate generalization ability of the model.

## 1. How to Build and Run the Code

Follow the steps below to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the analysis pipeline.

### Environment Setup

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To set up the environment:

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Temp0jd/CS506-Socioeconomic_Cancer_Analysis_And_Predicion.git
cd CS506-Socioeconomic_Cancer_Analysis_And_Predicion

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Makefile Instructions

This project provides a `Makefile` to simplify environment setup, dependency management, notebook execution, and testing.

Here are the available commands:

1. **Set up environment and install dependencies**

Create a new virtual environment `.venv/`, upgrade pip, and install all required packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
make setup
```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook to run the code interactively**

Start a Jupyter Notebook server to run and explore the project notebooks manually:

```bash
make run
```

3. **Install dependencies only**

If you already have a virtual environment, you can simply install the project dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

4. **Run tests**

Run all test scripts located under the `tests/` directory using `pytest`.

```bash
make test
```

5. **Clean the environment**

Remove the virtual environment `.venv/` and temporary files.

```bash
make clean
```

## 2. Testing and GitHub Workflow

To ensure the reproducibility and robustness of the project, we implemented tests under the `tests/` directory using `pytest`.

The tests are designed not only to check data existence or basic value correctness, but also to verify that the core pipeline runs correctly given a snippet of the expected data format.

### Test Scripts

- `test_data_loading.py`  
  Verifies that the prediction output file (`linear_regression_predictions.csv`) can be loaded successfully and contains expected data.

- `test_model_output.py`  
  Checks that the model output includes a `Predicted` column and that it contains no missing (NaN) values.

- `test_pipeline_run.py`  
  Simulates a small sample input with the expected structure (e.g., `povertypercent`, `medincome`, `popest2015`, `avgdeathsperyear`) and validates that the preprocessing and modeling pipeline runs without errors.  
  This test helps catch issues such as:
  - Missing or renamed columns
  - Changed data types or unexpected formats
  - Silent logic failures during training or prediction

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is configured to automatically:

1. Set up a Python environment with dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
2. Run the full test suite using `pytest`

This continuous integration workflow ensures that any new commits are automatically checked for functionality and data consistency, helping maintain the project's reliability over time.

## 3. Data Visualizations

This section presents key visualizations used to explore the relationships between socioeconomic factors and cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S.

### 3.1 Correlation Matrix

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/correlation_heatmap.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
The correlation matrix shows relationships between socioeconomic indicators and cancer-related outcomes. Notable patterns include:
- Strong positive correlation between average cancer cases and deaths
- Strong negative correlation between income and poverty
- Moderate negative correlation between higher education rates and cancer mortality

### 3.2 Poverty Rate vs. Cancer Deaths

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/poverty_vs_deaths.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
Counties with higher poverty percentages tend to report more cancer-related deaths on average. Although the overall trend is positive, considerable variance exists, suggesting other contributing factors.

### 3.3 Education vs. Cancer Deaths

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/education_vs_deaths.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
A generally negative trend appears: counties with higher composite education scores report fewer cancer deaths. However, variance across the data points indicates a multifactorial relationship.

### 3.4 Cancer Deaths Across U.S. Regions

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/Cancer_deaths_regions.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
Boxplots grouped by U.S. Census regions show the South consistently has a higher median and a wider range of cancer death counts. The West region includes several outliers with unusually high values.

### 3.5 Cancer Mortality Rate by State

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/cancer_mortality_by_state.png" width="800"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
- States in the South and Midwest, such as **Mississippi**, **Kentucky**, and **West Virginia**, exhibit notably high mortality rates.
- Western and Northeastern states tend to have comparatively lower death rates.
- These patterns align with known socioeconomic and healthcare access disparities in the U.S.

**Interactive Features (via Plotly):**
- The map is implemented using Plotly's interactive `choropleth` function.
- When run inside the Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/interactive_viz.ipynb`), users can:
  - **Hover** over each state to view the exact death rate.
  - **Zoom** or **pan** for closer examination.
  - **Access tooltips** that dynamically display state-level metrics.

### 3.6 Interactive Visualizations

To enable dynamic exploration of trends in cancer mortality and socioeconomic indicators, we implemented interactive plots using Plotly.

- **Interactive Choropleth Map:**  
  Users can zoom, pan, and hover over each U.S. state to view its cancer mortality rate per 100,000 residents.

- **Interactive Scatter Plot:**  
  Displays the relationship between poverty rate and average cancer deaths. Hovering reveals state details, and a trendline highlights the overall pattern.

> For interactive versions of the plots, see: `notebooks/interactive_viz.ipynb` - (Preparation of the environment is needed before running the code)

All results directly support the project goals of analyzing the impact of socioeconomic factors on cancer outcomes.

## Results

This section focuses on model performance and outputs from both linear regression and XGBoost models. The evaluation emphasizes model accuracy, error behavior, and key predictive features.

### Actual vs Predicted (Linear Regression)

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/actual_vs_predicted.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
The linear regression model demonstrates a general positive alignment between actual and predicted cancer death rates. However, considerable spread around the diagonal line reveals systematic under- and over-predictions, especially for extreme values.

**Interpretation:**  
While linear regression captures broad trends, its limited flexibility makes it less effective for counties with unusually high or low death rates.

### Actual vs Predicted (XGBoost)

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/xgboost_predictions.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
Compared to the linear model, the XGBoost regression predictions align more tightly with the actual values, with reduced dispersion and fewer extreme errors.

**Interpretation:**  
XGBoostâ€™s ability to model non-linear relationships and interactions allows it to achieve better prediction accuracy, especially in mid- and high-death regions.

### Residuals vs Predicted Values

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/residual_plot.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Observation:**  
Residuals are mostly centered around zero, indicating minimal bias. However, heteroscedasticity appears at higher predicted values, with a few large deviations suggesting outlier behavior.

**Interpretation:**  
While the model performs well overall, extreme cancer mortality cases may be influenced by latent factors not included in the model (e.g., pollution, comorbidities).

### Feature Importance (XGBoost)

<p align="center">
  <img src="plots/feature_importance.png" width="750"/>
</p>

**Note:**  
Feature IDs correspond to preprocessed variables. The mapping is:

| Rank | Feature ID | Feature Name |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1    | F1         | `popest2015` |
| 2    | F0         | `medincome` |
| 3    | F6         | `pctnohs18_24` |
| 4    | F7         | `pcths18_24` |
| 5    | F9         | `pcths25_over` |
| 6    | F3         | `medianage` |
| 7    | F20        | `birthrate` |
| 8    | F8         | `pctbachdeg18_24` |
| 9    | F17        | `pctwhite` |
| 10   | F11        | `pctemployed16_over` |

**Interpretation:**  
Population size, income, and educational attainment dominate the model's decision logic. This reinforces the hypothesis that socioeconomic factors are strong drivers of cancer mortality variations across counties.
